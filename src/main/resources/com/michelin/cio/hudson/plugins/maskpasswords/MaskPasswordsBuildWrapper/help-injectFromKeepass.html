	When ticked, every password, user ID and URL from every KeePass database defined in the global 
	config will be injected as environment variables. Only the passwords will be masked. The values 
	will be available as variables with the following naming patterns:
	<ul>
		<li>User ID: [entryTitle]_userId</li>
		<li>Password: [entryTitle]_pass</li>
		<li>URL: [entryTitle]_url</li>
	</ul>
	Where any spaces in entryTitle are replaced with underscores [_].

	When unticked, every password in every KeePass database will be masked if it appears in 
	the console output, but no values from KeePass will be available as environment variables.
